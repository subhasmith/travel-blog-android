Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barkside.travellocblog

Light-weight app to create a list of notes with locations and timestamps and to save it in KML format.

Version 2.2.0
=============
November 2013

 * App widgets can be installed on the home screen to jump to the New Post editing screen.
   Multiple widgets can be installed, each widget can point to a different trip file.
   Each widget invokes a configuration screen on install, which allows user to select
   an existing trip file, or create a new trip file, or to use the app default last used
   trip file on widget click.
   
 * Importing capability added. Other Android applications can now send .kml files to this app.
   This screen will show the imported KML data on a map, with a Save As file name option.   
   
 * The EditBlogElement activity now shows a appropriate subtitle - "New Post" or "Edit Post"
   as appropriate. It also shows the index number of the entry being added or edited.
   Edit Location screen also shows the same number.
   
 * Rename Trip menu command added. This and Delete Trip is now under a Manage Trips submenu.
 
 * Open Trip menu command now available from Map Trip activity also
 
 * Alert dialog now displayed if there is an error saving edited blog post or deleting a post.
   This used to be just a brief Toast message, but since failing to update trip file is a
   serious error, display it in a dialog box and do not terminate the edit activity.
   User can still use Cancel button, or the device back or parent button or home button to
   move to a new activity.
 
 * Send feedback email now contains app version code and number, and subject includes
   device information.
   
 * Map Trip screen now shows the trip info in the activity subtitle.
   This shows the number of locations in the map, and total distance of the segments.
   Distance units can be miles or km, and can be changed in the Settings menu.
 
 * MapTripFragment is now a fragment, and the code/UI for this fragment is loaded into
   two activities - the Map Trip screen, and the Import Trip screen.

 * Trip names can now be created with . (period) allowed.
   Disallowed characters are: / \ * ? < > : as of this release.

 * Use Intent.setData and Uri to start the main activities. For example, the New Post and
   Edit Post activity is started with content://AUTHORITY/blogname/index and action name
   Intent.ACTION_INSERT_OR_EDIT.
   
 * All older releases may have had a rare and obscure window which could have resulted in
   losing entries. See comments in EditBlogElement.onResume. This is all theoretical, but
   now should be fixed in a bunch of protection mechanisms:
   Internally created a new data manager to allow multiple activities to share a single
   trip file object so it has to be loaded only once instead of multiple times. And at
   specific call points, we verify we have correct data and will raise an AssertionError
   to terminate the app if continuing will lead to corruption.
   Activities now always reload data in onResume in case some other Travel Blog activity
   in the Android back stack edited the same trip, so that each activity always has
   the correct data loaded at all times.
   EditBlogElement additionally makes sure that it is editing the same entry as it was before
   re-entering an onResume call otherwise it will terminate the activity to avoid corrupting
   the trip file.
   
   
 * Updated a bunch of drawable ic_ icons. Added ic_action_done checkmark.

Version 2.0.1
============
October 2013

 * Editing location points now possible using visual maps to update the address.

 * Single click on blog entry in the main list now shows details of the entry and provides editing capability same as the "Edit Post" context command.
 
 * Single click on the location longitude,latitude text will open up the visual location editor.

 * Send feedback command added. It uses email, and displays a Privacy Notice before proceeding.
   Email is sent to the travel blog google groups mailing list which is publicly viewable.

 * Now uses Google Play Services API, which takes care of power usage and provides a Fused location provider for updating location info.
   The new Location API handles power and accuracy on its own. So we no can longer shut it off by looking at the provider type, instead, we just keep updating the location for a brief amount of time that can be set by the user.
   After that, the updater is shut off to conserve battery.

 * Added Setting menu option to allow user preference settings.
   Current settings include how long should new notes look for location updates, and whether to create default descriptions with current date and time for a new note. 

 * There is no Retry Location fix anymore, to avoid complexity. The new Location Api should give a pretty good location fix fast, and user can always edit the location on a map.
  
 * Fixed reported issue#2 kml file format now correctly adds the xmlns attribute to kml tag and not the Document tag.

 * Minimum Android version: Android 2.2 (Froyo and newer).
   Required SDK Version is now 8 (was 4).  Google Play Services (to display maps, get location updates using the Fused provider) requires Android 2.2+.
   See http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html
   Also using V7 and V4 support libraries to use things like ActionBar and SupportMapFragment
   to deploy in pre-Android 3.0 versions.
