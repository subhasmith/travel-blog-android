Light-weight app to create a list of locations and notes and
save it in KML format.

Version 2.0.0
=============
September 2013

- Now uses Google Play Services API, which takes care of power usage
  and provides a Fused location provider for updating location info.
 
- Editing location points now possible using visual maps to update the address.

- Single click on blog entry in the main list now shows details of the entry
  and provides editing capability same as the "Edit Post" context command.
 
- Single click on the location longitude,latitude text will open up the
  visual location editor.

- The new Location API handles power and accuracy on its own. So we no longer
  can shut it off by looking at the provider type, instead, we just keep
  updating the location for a brief amount of time - around 15 seconds or so.
  After that, the updater is shut off to conserve battery.

- There is no Retry Location fix anymore, to avoid complexity. The new
  Location Api should give a pretty good location fix fast, and user can
  always edit the location on a map.
  If there is demand, will add this back in a later release.
  
- Fixed issue#2 kml file format now correctly adds the xmlns attribute to kml
  tag and not the Document tag.

- Minimum Android SDK Version is now 10 (was 4) so supports Android 2.3.3 and
  above only (Gingerbread and newer).
  Google Play Services (to display maps, get location updates using the Fused
  provider) requires Android 2.2 or higher.
  See http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html
  Also using android-support-v4.jar for android.support.v4.app.Fragment which
  is needed for SupportMapFragment usage. Necessary to support Android SDK
  versions older than 12.
