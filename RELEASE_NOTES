Light-weight app to create a list of notes with locations and timestamps and to save it in KML format.

Version 2.0.0
============
October 2013

 * Editing location points now possible using visual maps to update the address.

 * Single click on blog entry in the main list now shows details of the entry and provides editing capability same as the "Edit Post" context command.
 
 * Single click on the location longitude,latitude text will open up the visual location editor.

 * Send feedback command added. It uses email, and displays a Privacy Notice before proceeding.
   Email is sent to the travel blog google groups mailing list which is publicly viewable.

 * Now uses Google Play Services API, which takes care of power usage and provides a Fused location provider for updating location info.
   The new Location API handles power and accuracy on its own. So we no can longer shut it off by looking at the provider type, instead, we just keep updating the location for a brief amount of time that can be set by the user.
   After that, the updater is shut off to conserve battery.

 * Added Setting menu option to allow user preference settings.
   Current settings include how long should new notes look for location updates, and whether to create default descriptions with current date and time for a new note. 

 * There is no Retry Location fix anymore, to avoid complexity. The new Location Api should give a pretty good location fix fast, and user can always edit the location on a map.
  
 * Fixed reported issue#2 kml file format now correctly adds the xmlns attribute to kml tag and not the Document tag.

 * Minimum Android version: Android 2.2 (Froyo and newer).
   Required SDK Version is now 8 (was 4).  Google Play Services (to display maps, get location updates using the Fused provider) requires Android 2.2+.
   See http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html
   Also using V7 and V4 support libraries to use things like ActionBar and SupportMapFragment
   to deploy in pre-Android 3.0 versions.
